# UI/UX Engineer Challenge

> ✨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like [@snowpack/plugin-webpack](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/main/plugins/plugin-webpack) or [snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle](https://github.com/ParamagicDev/snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle) to your `snowpack.config.json` config file.

### Q: What about Eject?

No eject needed! Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same.

## Challenge

Implement the provided app design using modern best practices for front-end web development. The expected flow is _Login Screen → Forgot Password → <Submit> → Login Screen with dismissible notification_. The primary areas of evaluation are code composition and attention to aesthetic detail. Please use React, React hooks, and your favorite CSS-in-JS framework to do the styling. Feel free to use an additional javascript libraries that will improve legibility of the code.
